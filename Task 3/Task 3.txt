We create publisher. We publish measurements from sensor every X seconds which are being sent on topic. We can subscribe this topic from other nodes to receive this information. When it comes to executing long time tasks it's good to create actions. Actions enable us to send long time goal and receive feedback during executing action. It is possible to send multiple goals and to stop whole action. In ROS we also have services which enables us to perform actions synchronomously. We send request and wait untill it will be executed
