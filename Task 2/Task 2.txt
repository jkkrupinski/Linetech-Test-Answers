Firstly I would insert local coordinate systems to all fragments of robot. Then I would define rotational matrixes with sin and cos functions and the angle of rotation along defined axis in previous coordinate system. The angles can be read from robot itsef. The local coordinate systems would be implemented so that writing eqasions would be easy. I would also need lengths of robot segments to create vectors from one coordinate system to the other (in local coordinate system). With vectors and matrixes ready I could write an equasion to calculate vector from origin of a coordinate system to end of effector (in original coordinate system). As to laser distance sensor I would treat it like a fragment of robot with changing length. The vector values would change based on reading from sensor. In this directory I added drawing to illustrate this concept. Drawing is in 2D because it is easer to draw on paper.
